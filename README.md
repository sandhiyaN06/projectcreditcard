# Credit Card Usage Trends Across Different Demographics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card usage trends based on various demographic factors, such as income level, occupation, and geographical location. By leveraging data analytics techniques, it provides insights into spending patterns, repayment behavior, and credit utilization rates, helping financial institutions, businesses, and policymakers make data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement
"Analyzing Credit Card Usage Trends Across Different Demographics to Understand Spending Behavior and Financial Patterns."

## Objectives
This study aims to analyze credit card usage trends among different demographic groups to:
- Identify key spending patterns and credit utilization behaviors.
- Understand expenditure differences based on age groups and income levels.
- Examine how spending habits vary across geographical locations.

## Significance
The insights derived from this analysis will assist:
- **Banks & Financial Institutions** in designing better credit policies and financial products.
- **Businesses & Marketers** in targeting customer segments with relevant offers.
- **Policymakers** in developing financial literacy programs to promote responsible credit usage.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
This project is implemented using **Python** and relies on the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and plotting.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset (`credit_card_trend.csv`) containing credit card transaction records with fields such as:
- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Monthly Income
- Transaction Amount
- Marital Status
- Spending Category
- City/State
- Credit Score
- Card Type

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: Examining key statistics related to spending behavior.
3. **Visualization**: Generating scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts to illustrate trends.
4. **Pivot Tables**: Analyzing credit usage based on different factors such as income level, age, and spending categories.

## Key Findings
- **Age-Based Spending Patterns**:
  - Young adults (18-30) spend more on entertainment, travel, and online shopping.
  - Middle-aged individuals (31-50) prioritize family expenses and loan payments.
  - Older adults (51+) focus on healthcare and utility bills.
- **Income-Based Credit Utilization**:
  - High-income earners use premium credit cards for luxury purchases.
  - Middle-income groups balance discretionary and essential spending.
  - Low-income individuals rely on credit for daily necessities.
- **Category-Wise Spending Trends**:
  - Groceries, utilities, and healthcare are common across all demographics.
  - Luxury goods and travel are prevalent among higher-income groups.
  - Education loans and EMIs are mostly used by younger individuals.

## Conclusion
The study provides valuable insights into credit card spending trends across demographics, benefiting:
- **Financial institutions** in optimizing risk assessment models.
- **Businesses** in improving marketing strategies based on consumer behavior.
- **Policymakers** in promoting financial literacy and responsible credit usage.
